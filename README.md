# Helios
Uni project completed using R.
Nothing too fancy, though an interesting story behind the project. Been sitting on my desktop forever, so why not upload to GitHub :)
This is half of the final version - there was a custom SQL creation tool, created using PHP and MySQL that is in my other repository. Go there instead, quick!
Coded in ~8 weeks starting from nothing - R is pretty cool to use.
Any questions let me know - darren.levett@hotmail.com :)
